# Within this coding practical I  had to use decision trees. This is a supervised learning method to which we breakdown data for classification. 
# The different subsets is what creates the tree like effect, where the internal nodes represent a test. 
# The importance of decision trees is the value they give in producing clear visualisation of data from large datasets.
